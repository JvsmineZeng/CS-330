## How do I approach designing software?

> ### What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
> This project helped me learn how to conceptualize, plan, program, and execute an assignment. I also learned how to use multiple dependencies for the project. Setting up the integrated development environment was also a challenge in itself. I think overall, designing with the big picture in mind helped me make sure I got all the steps right along the way.

> ### What design process did you follow for your project work?
> As mentioned before, I conceptualized, planned, programmed, and executed. These were the main phases of my project, and some of these phases were used together—such as planning and programming for each vertex in the scene of the house. I always double checked and debugged my work after each line of code was changed. I made sure to be meticulous so that I would know what in the design was changing and why. This was especially important when making sure that I was putting the vertices in counter-clockwise order.

> ### How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
> I modeled my design approach after the software development lifecycle (SDLC), which I learned in an SDLC course a couple of semesters ago. I will continue using this framework since it has helped me organize myself and my code for each project I have used this in. I think overall, being repetitive and adapting to/learning from changes are the ultimate skills that will set me up for success in the future.

## How do I approach developing programs?

> ### What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
> I organized my project into much more specific objects than I have done before. For example, the code for shaders, lighting, mesh, and shapes each had their own header and source files. This was unlike other programs I have developed for my degree since they were able to use one header and source file without risk of confusion or disorganization. 

> ### How did iteration factor into your development?
> I used iteration to mesh vertices with color and texture data. This can be shown in the mesh, application, and types header and source files. This allowed me to call the mesh class variables and functions for each vertex in my scene, and there was plenty of them.

> ### How has your approach to developing code evolved through the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
> Each milestone approached a different factor in the project. Having milestones delegated to different weeks allowed me to focus on each factor at different times. The order in which the milestones were assigned also helped me build up my project in an organized and logical manner. For example, I felt comfortable knowing I had a week to set up my shapes before I had to worry about programming textures onto the shapes.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

> ### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
> This course has helped me do plenty of research on the dependencies I used in the project. I was able to refer to many tutorials, but also the official website that addressed every single function available for me to use. This also helped me create discipline when organizing a large project such as this. This is my largest and most challenging project to-date.

> ### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
> Like before, I will be able to refer to official sources that will teach me how to use new dependencies and open source libraries. I think this project also helped me create a habit of double-checking my work with every line of code I wrote and/or edited. Overall, I not only learned how to persevere through the challenges in the work, I learned from them too.
